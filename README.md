This is a camera controller. Each "node" contains outputs to control one or two cameras.  Camera nodes can communicate to each others over an RF link. Two nodes make up a system, say one at the flight line and one up close to the rocket. Liftoffs can be triggered by a variety of sensors to detect lift-off, or manually via a foot switch.

Schematic, BOM, JLBPCB files and firmware are all included.
Note:  Even those some files are labelled "CameraTriggerSensorNodeOnly" they are really Camera nodes.
